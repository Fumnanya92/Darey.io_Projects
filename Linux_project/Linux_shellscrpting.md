# Bash script for Generating a Multiplication Table

### user input for number: 
The script must first ask user to input a number for which the multiplication table to be generated 

### Choice of Table Range: 
Next, ask the user if they want a full multiplication table (1 to 10) or a partial table. If they choose partial, prompt them for the start and end of the range

### Use of Loops:
Implement the logic to generate the multiplication table using loops. You may use either the list form or C-style for loop based on what's appropriate

### Conditional Logic: 
Use if-else statements to handle the logic based on the user's choices (full vs. partial table and valid range input).

### Input Validation: 
Ensure that the user enters valid numbers for the multiplication table and the specified range Provide feedback for invalid inputs and default to a full table if the range is incorrect
