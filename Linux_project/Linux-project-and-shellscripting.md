## Objectives

1. **Script Enhancement:**
    - Extend the provided script to include IAM management.
    
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    # Environment variables
    ENVIRONMENT=$1

    check_num_of_args() {
    # Checking the number of arguments
    if [ "$#" -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Usage: $0 <environment>"
        exit 1
    fi
    }

    activate_infra_environment() {
    # Acting based on the argument value
    if [ "$ENVIRONMENT" == "local" ]; then
      echo "Running script for Local Environment..."
    elif [ "$ENVIRONMENT" == "testing" ]; then
      echo "Running script for Testing Environment..."
    elif [ "$ENVIRONMENT" == "production" ]; then
      echo "Running script for Production Environment..."
    else
      echo "Invalid environment specified. Please use 'local', 'testing', or 'production'."
      exit 2
    fi
    }

    # Function to check if AWS CLI is installed
    check_aws_cli() {
        if ! command -v aws &> /dev/null; then
            echo "AWS CLI is not installed. Please install it before proceeding."
            return 1
        fi
    }

    # Function to check if AWS profile is set
    check_aws_profile() {
        if [ -z "$AWS_PROFILE" ]; then
            echo "AWS profile environment variable is not set."
            return 1
        fi
    }

    # Function to create EC2 Instances
    create_ec2_instances() {

        # Specify the parameters for the EC2 instances
        instance_type="t2.micro"
        ami_id="ami-0cd59ecaf368e5ccf"  
        count=2  # Number of instances to create
        region="eu-west-2" # Region to create cloud resources
        
        # Create the EC2 instances
        aws ec2 run-instances \
            --image-id "$ami_id" \
            --instance-type "$instance_type" \
            --count $count
            --key-name MyKeyPair
            
        # Check if the EC2 instances were created successfully
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            echo "EC2 instances created successfully."
        else
            echo "Failed to create EC2 instances."
        fi
    }

    # Function to create S3 buckets for different departments
    create_s3_buckets() {
        # Define a company name as prefix
        company="datawise"
        # Array of department names
        departments=("Marketing" "Sales" "HR" "Operations" "Media")
        
        # Loop through the array and create S3 buckets for each department
        for department in "${departments[@]}"; do
            bucket_name="${company}-${department}-Data-Bucket"
            # Create S3 bucket using AWS CLI
            aws s3api create-bucket --bucket "$bucket_name" --region your-region
            if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
                echo "S3 bucket '$bucket_name' created successfully."
            else
                echo "Failed to create S3 bucket '$bucket_name'."
            fi
        done
    }

    check_num_of_args
    activate_infra_environment
    check_aws_cli
    check_aws_profile
    create_ec2_instances
    create_s3_buckets
    ```

2. **Define IAM User Names Array:**
    - Store the names of the five IAM users in an array for easy iteration during user creation.

    ```bash
    # Define IAM User Names Array
    iam_users=("user1" "user2" "user3" "user4" "user5")
    ```

3. **Create IAM Users:**
    - Iterate through the IAM user names array and create IAM users for each employee using AWS CLI commands.

    ```bash
    create_iam_users() {
        for user in "${iam_users[@]}"; do
            aws iam create-user --user-name "$user"
            if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
                echo "IAM user '$user' created successfully."
            else
                echo "Failed to create IAM user '$user'."
            fi
        done
    }
    ```

4. **Create IAM Group:**
    - Define a function to create an IAM group named "admin" using the AWS CLI.

    ```bash
    create_iam_group() {
        aws iam create-group --group-name admin
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            echo "IAM group 'admin' created successfully."
        else
            echo "Failed to create IAM group 'admin'."
        fi
    }
    ```

5. **Attach Administrative Policy to Group:**
    - Attach an AWS-managed administrative policy (e.g., "AdministratorAccess") to the "admin" group to grant administrative privileges.

    ```bash
    attach_admin_policy_to_group() {
        aws iam attach-group-policy --group-name admin --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            echo "Administrative policy attached to group 'admin' successfully."
        else
            echo "Failed to attach policy to group 'admin'."
        fi
    }
    ```

6. **Assign Users to Group:**
    - Iterate through the array of IAM user names and assign each user to the "admin" group using AWS CLI commands.

    ```bash
    assign_users_to_group() {
        for user in "${iam_users[@]}"; do
            aws iam add-user-to-group --user-name "$user" --group-name admin
            if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
                echo "IAM user '$user' added to group 'admin' successfully."
            else
                echo "Failed to add IAM user '$user' to group 'admin'."
            fi
        done
    }
    ```
