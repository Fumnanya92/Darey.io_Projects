# Working with pods

**Definition and Purpose:**

A Pod in Kubernetes is like a small box for running parts of an application. It can have one or more containers inside that work closely together, sharing the same network and storage. This makes communication and cooperation easy. A Pod is the smallest unit you can create and manage in Kubernetes. In Minikube, which is a tool for running Kubernetes easily, Pods are used to set up, resize, and control applications.
